            "Q1: 0.6727\n",
            "Question: How often should I take my dog to the vet?\n",
            "Prediction: The context suggests that for \"core\" vaccinations, either annual or every three years revaccination is typically recommended. Given that your dog will need to see the vet regularly for well-dog exams anyway, these visits can serve as opportunities to administer or discuss the core vaccines. Therefore, you should take your dog to the vet at least annually, but your vet may recommend specific intervals for different vaccines.\n",
            "Ground Truth: At minimum, adult dogs should have an annual wellness exam. Puppies require more frequent visits for vaccinations and checkups, while senior dogs (7+ years) benefit from twice-yearly visits to catch age-related issues early.\n",
            "\n",
            "Q2: 0.6440\n",
            "Question: What vaccines does my dog need?\n",
            "Prediction: Based on the provided context, the vaccines your dog needs depend on its risk factors, which are influenced by its age, immune competence, exposure, and stress levels. Some vaccines are designed to prevent disease, while others reduce severity. Only dogs at risk for infection should receive noncore vaccinations. It's recommended to consult with a veterinarian to determine the most appropriate vaccines for your dog based on its specific needs and local disease prevalence.\n",
            "Ground Truth: Core vaccines include rabies, distemper, parvovirus, and adenovirus. Non-core vaccines may include Bordetella (kennel cough), leptospirosis, and Lyme — depending on lifestyle and location. A veterinarian will tailor the schedule to your dog's risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "Q3: 0.8976\n",
            "Question: How can I tell if my dog is in pain?\n",
            "Prediction: Based on the provided context, signs of pain in a dog can include hiding, remaining very still and quiet, becoming vocal, acting agitated, panting or drooling, refusing food, and flinching, yelping, or snapping when touched in a tender place. If you notice any of these signs, it is recommended to have your dog checked by a veterinarian.\n",
            "Ground Truth: Dogs often hide pain. Signs include limping, whining, reduced activity, aggression, licking a specific area, or changes in eating or behavior. Any of these warrant a veterinary exam.\n",
            "\n",
            "Q4: 0.5430\n",
            "Question: Can dogs eat human food?\n",
            "Prediction: The context does not provide specific information about dogs eating human food. However, it does mention that dogs are omnivores with a strong preference for meat, and that their ancestors ate what they could catch or scavenge. It also states that owners should ensure the canine diet is appropriate. Therefore, while some human foods may be safe for dogs, it's crucial to ensure that any human food given to a dog is non-toxic and appropriate for their dietary needs.\n",
            "Ground Truth: Some human foods are safe in moderation (like plain cooked chicken or rice), but many are toxic — such as chocolate, grapes, onions, garlic, and xylitol. Always consult a vet before sharing human food.\n",
            "\n",
            "Q5: 0.6595\n",
            "Question: Why is my dog itching so much?\n",
            "Prediction: Based on the provided context, your dog's excessive itching could be due to allergies. These allergies could be the source of secretions that, when not regularly expressed, can become pasty and thick, leading to blockage of the normal exit. This can cause discomfort and further itching. If your dog is also licking excessively and showing signs of infection or odor, it would be advisable to consult with a veterinarian.\n",
            "Ground Truth: Common causes include fleas, allergies (environmental or food), and skin infections. A vet will perform diagnostics like skin scrapings or allergy testing to identify the cause and recommend treatment.\n",
            "\n",
            "Q6: 0.4690\n",
            "Question: Should I spay or neuter my dog?\n",
            "Prediction: The decision to spay or neuter your dog should consider several factors. Neutering, which is surgical castration, does significantly reduce the chance of certain infections and problems related to testosterone. However, recent studies suggest that the removal of 100 percent of a dog's testosterone may pose problems, depending on the breed and timing. \n",
            "\n",
            "If you have a puppy you hope to develop into a hunting, herding, or other athletic dog, you might want to consider these potential consequences. \n",
            "\n",
            "On the other hand, spaying or neutering can lower the incidence of some canine diseases, especially in dogs that are likely to interact with other dogs. \n",
            "\n",
            "Given these variables, it's important to consult with your veterinarian. They can provide the most reliable advice and help design an appropriate vaccination program for your dog's specific needs.\n",
            "Ground Truth: Yes, unless you plan to breed responsibly. Spaying/neutering helps prevent reproductive cancers, reduces behavioral issues, and lowers overpopulation risks. Timing depends on breed and age — typically between 6–12 months.\n",
            "\n",
            "Q7: 0.8693\n",
            "Question: Why is my dog eating grass?\n",
            "Prediction: Dogs may eat grass as a natural emetic to stimulate vomiting when they feel unwell, or they might simply enjoy its flavor or texture. There is also speculation that grass grazing may provide trace elements of vitamins. Occasional grass eating is usually not a cause for concern, but if it becomes a habit, especially if grass eating prompts vomiting more than two days in a row, your dog should be examined by a veterinarian to rule out a health problem.\n",
            "Ground Truth: Occasional grass-eating is normal and not necessarily harmful. Some dogs do it out of boredom or to induce vomiting. Frequent grass consumption or vomiting should be evaluated by a vet.\n",
            "\n",
            "Q8: 0.8347\n",
            "Question: How do I clean my dog’s ears safely?\n",
            "Prediction: According to the provided context, to clean your dog's ears safely, you should use a 50/50 vinegar and water solution or commercial ear cleaning solution on a cotton ball, soft cloth, or cotton swab. Gently wipe only the visible portions of the ear, avoiding dripping cleaner or inserting any instrument into the ear canal unless instructed by your veterinarian. For breeds like Cocker Spaniels with pendulous ears, a weekly cleaning with a drying agent can help improve aeration and drainage. It's also important to keep the ears dry and clean, and to inspect for debris after outdoor activities.\n",
            "Ground Truth: Use a vet-approved ear cleaner. Gently fill the ear canal, massage the base, and wipe debris with gauze or cotton (never insert Q-tips). Do not clean ears unless recommended by your vet, especially if infected.\n",
            "\n",
            "Q9: 0.7460\n",
            "Question: Is bad breath in dogs normal?\n",
            "Prediction: Based on the provided context, bad breath in dogs is not normal. It's often a sign of an underlying health issue, similar to dental problems that people can experience. The earliest sign of gum and tooth infections in dogs is bad breath, also known as halitosis.\n",
            "Ground Truth: No — persistent bad breath may indicate dental disease, infections, or systemic issues like kidney disease. Routine dental care and veterinary cleanings are crucial for overall health.\n",
            "\n",
            "Q10: 0.6369\n",
            "Question: How do I know if my dog has worms?\n",
            "Prediction: Your dog may have worms if you notice signs such as a dull coat, diarrhea (which could be watery or contain blood or mucus), or if you see spaghetti-like masses in the stool or vomit. Additionally, if your dog has worms in the lungs, it may cough. Confirmation of roundworms can be made by your veterinarian through a stool sample examination, where the presence of eggs indicates adult worms in the intestines.\n",
            "Ground Truth: Symptoms may include visible worms in stool, scooting, vomiting, weight loss, or a bloated abdomen. A fecal exam by your vet will confirm the type of parasite and proper deworming treatment.\n",
